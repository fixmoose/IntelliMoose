# Investment Risk Disclosures

**IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING**

This document outlines the material risks associated with investing in IntelliMoose. By proceeding with an investment, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accept these risks.

---

## Executive Summary

**Investing in early-stage startups is highly speculative and involves substantial risk of loss.** You should only invest funds that you can afford to lose entirely. There is no guarantee of return on investment, and the likelihood of losing your entire investment is significant.

---

## Material Risks

### 1. Risk of Total Loss

**You may lose your entire investment.**

- Early-stage companies have a high failure rate (70-90% of startups fail)
- IntelliMoose is pre-revenue and has not validated product-market fit
- No guarantee that the company will achieve profitability or liquidity
- In the event of failure, investors may receive nothing

### 2. Illiquidity Risk

**Your investment will be illiquid for an extended period.**

- No active market for IntelliMoose securities
- Expect to hold investment for 7-10+ years
- No guarantee of liquidity event (acquisition, IPO, secondary sale)
- Restrictions on transfer of securities per investment agreement
- Difficult or impossible to sell shares before exit

### 3. Dilution Risk

**Your ownership percentage will likely be diluted.**

- Company will raise additional funding rounds at potentially lower valuations
- Employee stock options and advisor grants will dilute ownership
- Convertible notes and SAFEs convert at future valuations (may be unfavorable)
- No anti-dilution protection for early investors
- Your percentage ownership will decrease over time

### 4. Technology & Product Risks

**The technology may not work as intended or may become obsolete.**

- Edge AI inference is technically complex and unproven at scale
- Model accuracy, battery life, and performance may not meet expectations
- Rapid technological change may render approach obsolete
- Competitors may develop superior technology
- Dependencies on third-party hardware (Raspberry Pi, smart glasses) create supply chain risk
- Patent applications may be rejected or provide insufficient protection

### 5. Market Risks

**The target markets may not materialize or adopt the product.**

- Uncertain demand for offline AI in target verticals
- Skilled trades, security, and other verticals may resist new technology
- Existing solutions (cloud AI, traditional tools) may be "good enough"
- Market adoption may be slower than projected
- Pricing assumptions may be incorrect
- Distribution partnerships may not materialize

### 6. Competitive Risks

**Well-funded competitors may outcompete IntelliMoose.**

- Big Tech (Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft) has vastly greater resources
- Competitors may launch similar products at lower prices or superior quality
- Ray-Ban Meta and similar devices already have market presence
- Open-source alternatives may emerge
- Patents may not provide sufficient protection
- First-mover advantage may not be sustainable

### 7. Execution Risks

**The founding team may fail to execute the business plan.**

- Dejan Obradovic is a solo founder (higher risk than co-founder teams)
- Team has not yet been fully assembled
- Hiring qualified engineers (hardware, AI/ML) may be difficult
- Manufacturing, supply chain, and quality control are complex
- Certifications (ANSI, FCC, CE) may be delayed or denied
- Budget may be insufficient; company may run out of cash

### 8. Regulatory & Legal Risks

**Regulatory changes or legal issues may harm the business.**

- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) may restrict use cases
- AI regulations (EU AI Act, etc.) may impose compliance costs
- Safety certification requirements may change
- Liability for AI errors (e.g., wrong electrical code advice) could result in lawsuits

### 9. Financial Risks

- Unit economics may be worse than projected
- Manufacturing costs may be higher than estimated
- Customer acquisition costs may be prohibitive
- Burn rate may exceed expectations
- Company may require more funding than anticipated (down rounds, unfavorable terms)

### 10. No Guarantee of Exit

**There is no guarantee of a liquidity event.**

- Company may never be acquired or go public
- Even if successful, exit may take 10+ years
- Acquisition offers may value company below investor cost basis
- IPO market may be unfavorable
- Company may remain private indefinitely

### 11. Valuation Risk

**The current valuation may be inflated.**

- Pre-money valuation of $18-22M is based on future projections, not current value
- Comparable companies may not be truly comparable
- Next funding round may occur at lower valuation (down round)
- Liquidation preferences may mean common shareholders receive nothing in exit

### 12. Conflicts of Interest

**Management may have interests that conflict with investors.**

- Founder compensation, equity grants, and decision-making authority
- Future funding rounds may favor new investors over existing investors
- Related party transactions (e.g., IP licensing, consulting agreements)
