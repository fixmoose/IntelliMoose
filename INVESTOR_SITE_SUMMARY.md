## 📊 What's Included in the Investor Site

### 9 Major Sections:

#### 1. **Hero Section**
- Opens with "The Edge AI Platform Powering Offline Intelligence"
- $500B+ TAM headline
- 4 key problems we're solving:
  - Cloud AI doesn't work everywhere
  - Privacy concerns growing
  - Subscription fatigue
  - Generic AI lacks domain expertise

#### 2. **Market Opportunity ($500B+ TAM)**
- **5 vertical markets** with detailed breakdowns:
  1. **Skilled Trades** - $12B TAM, $699 price point
  2. **Home Security** - $75B TAM, $399 price point
  3. **Fleet & Logistics** - $200B TAM, $999 price point
  4. **Defense & Law Enforcement** - $40B TAM, $3K-10K price point
  5. **Healthcare** - $12B TAM, $1.5K-2.5K price point

- **Why These Markets:**
  - Internet unreliability
  - Privacy requirements
  - Domain expertise needed
  - Subscription fatigue

#### 3. **Platform Editions Showcase**
- Shows all 5 product editions with:
  - Status (In Development, Planned, Roadmap)
  - Pricing
  - Key features
  - AI models used
  - Target integrations
  - Launch timeline

- **Platform Architecture Diagram:**
  - Application layer (5 editions)
  - Core platform (shared tech stack)
  - Hardware layer (economies of scale)

- **Why Platform Wins:**
  - Economies of scale
  - Fast iteration
  - Multiple revenue streams
  - Faster market entry

#### 4. **Competitive Landscape**
- **Comparison Table:** IntelliMoose vs. Cloud AI
  - Internet required: NO vs. YES
  - Privacy: On-device vs. Uploads to cloud
  - Pricing: One-time vs. $10-200/month
  - Latency: 50-200ms vs. 500ms-2s

- **6 Competitive Moats:**
  1. Offline-first DNA (Big Tech is cloud-first)
  2. Domain knowledge curation (manual, time-consuming)
  3. Privacy positioning (Big Tech can't claim this)
  4. Platform economics (one design, many verticals)
  5. Integration network effects (switching costs)
  6. Certification barriers (FedRAMP, FIPS, HIPAA)

- **Why Now:**
  - Open-source LLMs matured (2023-24)
  - Edge hardware caught up (RPI 5)
  - Privacy backlash peaked (2024-25)
  - Subscription fatigue (2025)

#### 5. **Technical Architecture**
- **Core Tech Stack:**
  - AI/ML: Llama 3.2, YOLOv8, Whisper.cpp, ChromaDB
  - Software: Linux, Python, llama.cpp, ONNX
  - Hardware: ARM Cortex-A76, 8-16GB RAM, 256GB-1TB storage

- **Technical Advantages:**
  - Fast inference (50-200ms)
  - All-day battery (8-12 hours)
  - Encrypted storage (AES-256)
  - OTA updates

#### 6. **Business Model & Economics**

## 🚀 How to Use This Site

Subject: IntelliMoose - Edge AI Platform ($1.5M Seed)

Hi [Name],

I'm building IntelliMoose, the edge AI platform powering offline intelligence across trades, security, fleet logistics, and defense.

We're solving a $500B problem: cloud AI fails in environments where professionals actually work (trucks, jobsites, rural areas). Our pocket AI device works 100% offline, connects to any smart glasses or device, and is pre-loaded with domain-specific knowledge.

Quick stats:
• $500B+ TAM across 5 verticals
• Raising $1.5-2M seed
• Pilot launching Q2 2025
• Platform approach (one tech, many markets)

I'd love 15 minutes to walk you through the opportunity:
→ [Investor Site Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

- Add site link to your profile
- Reference in your pitch
- Include in deal room materials

## 💡 Pro Tips for Fundraising

### Using This Site Effectively

1. **Don't send it cold** - Use email to tease, site to close
2. **Walk through it live** - Don't just share link
3. **Highlight moats** - Spend time on competitive section
4. **Show traction** - Update roadmap with pilot results
5. **Be data-driven** - Investors love the numbers

### What Investors Will Ask

**Based on this site, expect:**

1. "Why won't Big Tech do this?"
   → Answer: Conflicts with cloud business model, we have 12-24 month head start

2. "Can't you just use ChatGPT API?"
   → Answer: Requires internet, uploads data, costs $0.002/query at scale, we're $0/query

3. "How do you get the content (manuals, codes)?"
   → Answer: Public domain (NEC codes), partnerships with manufacturers, OCR for scanned docs

4. "What if one vertical fails?"
   → Answer: Platform approach = diversified risk, pivot to highest-traction market

5. "Why not focus on one vertical?"
   → Answer: Platform multiples > single-product. Trades validates tech, security is largest TAM

6. "How do you compete with $299 Ray-Ban Meta?"
   → Answer: We're not competing - they're social glasses, we're expertise delivery. Different markets.
