## What's Been Created

Your IntelliMoose glasses now have a **completely transparent background** and are floating in a **beautiful cloud of light and particles**!

## 🎨 Visual Effects Applied

### 1. Background Removal
- ✅ White background removed from glasses image

- ✅ Glasses now blend seamlessly with the dark background

### 2. Animated Cloud Layers (3 Layers)

**White Cloud (cloud-1)**

- 10-second float animation
- Adds futuristic feel

**Purple Cloud (cloud-3)**
- Purple (#8b5cf6) accent
- Completes the color harmony
- 12-second animation
- Tech/AI aesthetic

All clouds:
- Heavy blur (60px) for soft, ethereal look
- Float in different directions
- Scale up and down gently
- Low opacity (15%) for subtlety

### 3. Rising Particles (20 Particles)

**Particle Effects:**
- 20 individual cyan particles
- Rise from bottom to top
- Fade in and out smoothly
